Description: Implements automatically-tuned, tempered Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which constructs Markov chains having a given target density as the stationary density. In particular, this algorithm facilitates sampling from high-dimensional, strongly multimodal distributions. For more details, see Park (2024).
